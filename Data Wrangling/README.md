project: Wrangle and Analyse Data


In this project, we will wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The main purpose of this project is to use real world data to wrangle (gather, assess, clean) and then apply analysis with visualizations. The data used was from the Twitter account ‘WeRateDogs’ (@dog_rates) which “rates people's dogs with a humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.” (source, Udacity)
The following three datasets will be used in this project.
Enhanced Twitter Archive
Additional Data via the Twitter API
Image Predictions File
