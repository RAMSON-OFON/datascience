In this Project, we will go through the full data science life cycle, from data cleaning and feature Engineering and selection to machine learning. We will focus on credit modelling, a well-known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace here (https://www.lendingclub.com/company/about-us?).
