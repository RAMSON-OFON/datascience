 # Objectives : Effects of Loan features on ProsperScore

## Dataset.

The Prosper loan dataset comprises of 113937 loan entries with 81 attributes on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others, from the year 2009-2014. There are two main categories:

Borrower information: Basic attributes of the borrowers such as annual income, condition of employment, interest rate, loan status, etc.
Loan performance information: Metrics evaluating the risk associated with the loans such as Prosper score and bank card utilization, etc. There were some elements that need to be fixed, in order to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

Summary of Findings

Prosper Score is left skewed with majority of the score values ranging from 4 to 10. The highest of these values being between 8 and 9.

Majority of the borrowers are employed, seconded by part timeers while some full time. A few of them were self employed while very few were not employed.

Majority of the borrowers are professionals, computer pogrammers, Administrative assitance and teachers. while he rest fall in many of the available occupation.

Stated Monthly Income variable is highy skwed to the right with majority of the borroers bring middle and low income earners

Lower DebtToIncomeRatio means a good balance between debt and income. It appears from the figure above that most borrowers who applied for a loan have a debt to income ratio around 30%.
Interestingly, the distribution of debt to income ratio is similar to that of stated monthly in come.

Debt consolidation is the highest purpose for whcih people get to borrow money. Human Improvement, Business and some Personal loans are other notable categories in the loans by Listing Categories.

As sujested, prosperscore collerate possivetively with statedmonthly income which means, the higher your monthly income, the higher your prosper score , the higher your laon amount and the lesser the interest rate to be paid.
Prosperscore collerates negatuvely with debttoincomeratio. which means, the more debts you have to pay with your income, the lesser your prosper score and ofcourse, the lesser the amount of loan that can be given to you.

As expected, High and middle income earners have a higher prosper score than lower class income earners.
Full time workers, people who are employed, part time workers do have a higher score comapare to sel-employed and unemployed works. As expected, if your employed, you have a higher chance of paying your loan hence higher score.

As expeced, people who have a verifiable source of income have a higher prosper score than those without a verifiable source of income. Hence, Incomeverifiable is a strong determinant of the prosper score.
I expected that people who own houses should have a higher prosper score. But surprisingly, the score is thesame for those who own houses and those who dont own houses.

Occupation variable is a strong determinant of the prosper score
From the graph above, Mechnical Engineers, Analyst, Electrical Engineers, Excecutives, Pilots, Biologists are some of the few professions which high prosper score. While on the other occupations like homemakers, postal service, sales, teacher aid are amongs the few occupations with low score. This is properbly as a result of low salary earnings.

There were alot of features that strenthen each other such as:
Household Expenses, Mdedical/Dental, Auto, Home improvement, large purchase with short term loans have a higher score comapred to those with middle and long term loans Baby & Adoption, Engineering Ring, Motorcycle with Long term loans have a higher prosperscore comapred to middle and short term loans. Green Loans where availbe only for middle and long term loans
There is a strong variation of prosperscore for prople who are Employed and not employed with veriable source of income and those who are employed and not employed without a veriable shource of income.
Employees with good loan status have higher prosper score and those with bad loan status have a lower prosper score.
